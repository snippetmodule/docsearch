in `$GIT_DIR/remotes/&lt;origin&gt;</code> file is used.</p>   <p>In order to determine what remote branches to fetch (and optionally store in the remote-tracking branches) when the command is run without any refspec parameters on the command line, values of the configuration variable <code>remote.&lt;origin&gt;.fetch</code> are consulted, and if there aren’t any, <code>$GIT_DIR/remotes/&lt;origin&gt;</code> file is consulted and its `Pull: ` lines are used. In addition to the refspec formats described in the OPTIONS section, you can have a globbing refspec that looks like this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</pre> </div> </div>  <p>A globbing refspec must have a non-empty RHS (i.e. must store what were fetched in remote-tracking branches), and its LHS and RHS must end with <code>/*</code>. The above specifies that all remote branches are tracked using remote-tracking branches in <code>refs/remotes/origin/</code> hierarchy under the same name.</p>   <p>The rule to determine which remote branch to merge after fetching is a bit involved, in order not to break backward compatibility.</p>   <p>If explicit refspecs were given on the command line of <code>git pull</code>, they are all merged.</p>   <p>When no refspec was given on the command line, then <code>git pull</code> uses the refspec from the configuration or <code>$GIT_DIR/remotes/&lt;origin&gt;</code>. In such cases, the following rules apply:</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>If <code>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</code> configuration for the current branch <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> exists, that is the name of the branch at the remote site that is merged.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the refspec is a globbing one, nothing is merged.</p> </li> <li> <p>Otherwise the remote branch of the first refspec is merged.</p> </li> </ol> </div>
</div>   <h2 id="_examples">Examples</h2> <div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Update the remote-tracking branches for the repository you cloned from, then merge one of them into your current branch:</p> <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>$ git pull, git pull origin</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Normally the branch merged in is the HEAD of the remote repository, but the choice is determined by the branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote and branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge options; see <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a> for details.</p>  </li> <li> <p>Merge into the current branch the remote branch <code>next</code>:</p> <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>$ git pull origin next</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This leaves a copy of <code>next</code> temporarily in FETCH_HEAD, but does not update any remote-tracking branches. Using remote-tracking branches, the same can be done by invoking fetch and merge:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>$ git fetch origin
$ git merge origin/next</pre> </div> </div> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>If you tried a pull which resulted in complex conflicts and would want to start over, you can recover with <code>git reset</code>.</p> </div>   <h2 id="_bugs">Bugs</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <p>Using --recurse-submodules can only fetch new commits in already checked out submodules right now. When e.g. upstream added a new submodule in the just fetched commits of the superproject the submodule itself can not be fetched, making it impossible to check out that submodule later without having to do a fetch again. This is expected to be fixed in a future Git version.</p> </div>   <h2 id="_see_also">See also</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <p><a href="git-fetch">git-fetch[1]</a>, <a href="git-merge">git-merge[1]</a>, <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a></p> </div><div class="_attribution">
