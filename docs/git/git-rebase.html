Otherwise it remains on the current branch.</p>   <p>If &lt;upstream&gt; is not specified, the upstream configured in branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote and branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge options will be used (see <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a> for details) and the <code>--fork-point</code> option is assumed. If you are currently not on any branch or if the current branch does not have a configured upstream, the rebase will abort.</p>   <p>All changes made by commits in the current branch but that are not in &lt;upstream&gt; are saved to a temporary area. This is the same set of commits that would be shown by <code>git log &lt;upstream&gt;..HEAD</code>; or by <code>git log 'fork_point'..HEAD</code>, if <code>--fork-point</code> is active (see the description on <code>--fork-point</code> below); or by <code>git log HEAD</code>, if the <code>--root</code> option is specified.</p>   <p>The current branch is reset to &lt;upstream&gt;, or &lt;newbase&gt; if the --onto option was supplied. This has the exact same effect as <code>git reset --hard &lt;upstream&gt;</code> (or &lt;newbase&gt;). ORIG_HEAD is set to point at the tip of the branch before the reset.</p>   <p>The commits that were previously saved into the temporary area are then reapplied to the current branch, one by one, in order. Note that any commits in HEAD which introduce the same textual changes as a commit in HEAD..&lt;upstream&gt; are omitted (i.e., a patch already accepted upstream with a different commit message or timestamp will be skipped).</p>   <p>It is possible that a merge failure will prevent this process from being completely automatic. You will have to resolve any such merge failure and run <code>git rebase --continue</code>. Another option is to bypass the commit that caused the merge failure with <code>git rebase --skip</code>. To check out the original &lt;branch&gt; and remove the .git/rebase-apply working files, use the command <code>git rebase --abort</code> instead.</p>   <p>Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "topic":</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---F---G master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>From this point, the result of either of the following commands:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>git rebase master
git rebase master topic</pre> </div> </div>  <p>would be:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>                  A'--B'--C' topic
                 /
    D---E---F---G master</pre> </div> </div>  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The latter form is just a short-hand of <code>git checkout topic</code> followed by <code>git rebase master</code>. When rebase exits <code>topic</code> will remain the checked-out branch.</p>   <p>If the upstream branch already contains a change you have made (e.g., because you mailed a patch which was applied upstream), then that commit will be skipped. For example, running <code>git rebase master</code> on the following history (in which <code>A'</code> and <code>A</code> introduce the same set of changes, but have different committer information):</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---A'---F master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>will result in:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>                   B'---C' topic
                  /
    D---E---A'---F master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Here is how you would transplant a topic branch based on one branch to another, to pretend that you forked the topic branch from the latter branch, using <code>rebase --onto</code>.</p>   <p>First letâ€™s assume your <code>topic</code> is based on branch <code>next</code>. For example, a feature developed in <code>topic</code> depends on some functionality which is found in <code>next</code>.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    o---o---o---o---o  master
         \
          o---o---o---o---o  next
                           \
                            o---o---o  topic</pre> </div> </div>  <p>We want to make <code>topic</code> forked from branch <code>master</code>; for example, because the functionality on which <code>topic</code> depends was merged into the more stable <code>master</code> branch. We want our tree to look like this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    o---o---o---o---o  master
        |            \
        |             o'--o'--o'  topic
         \
          o---o---o---o---o  next</pre> </div> </div>  <p>We can get this using the following command:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>git rebase --onto master next topic</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Another example of --onto option is to rebase part of a branch. If we have the following situation:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>                            H---I---J topicB
                           /
                  E---F---G  topicA
                 /
    A---B---C---D  master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>then the command</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>git rebase --onto master topicA topicB</pre> </div> </div>  <p>would result in:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>                 H'--I'--J'  topicB
                /
                | E---F---G  topicA
                |/
    A---B---C---D  master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This is useful when topicB does not depend on topicA.</p>   <p>A range of commits could also be removed with rebase. If we have the following situation:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    E---F---G---H---I---J  topicA</pre> </div> </div>  <p>then the command</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>git rebase --onto topicA~5 topicA~3 topicA</pre> </div> </div>  <p>would result in the removal of commits F and G:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    E---H'---I'---J'  topicA</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This is useful if F and G were flawed in some way, or should not be part of topicA. Note that the argument to --onto and the &lt;upstream&gt; parameter can be any valid commit-ish.</p>   <p>In case of conflict, <code>git rebase</code> will stop at the first problematic commit and leave conflict markers in the tree. You can use <code>git diff</code> to locate the markers (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;) and make edits to resolve the conflict. For each file you edit, you need to tell Git that the conflict has been resolved, typically this would be done with</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>git add &lt;filename&gt;</pre> </div> </div>  <p>After resolving the conflict manually and updating the index with the desired resolution, you can continue the rebasing process with</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>git rebase --continue</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Alternatively, you can undo the <code>git rebase</code> with</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>git rebase --abort</pre> </div> </div>

See also RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE below.</p>   <p>When the git-rebase command is run, it will first execute a "pre-rebase" hook if one exists. You can use this hook to do sanity checks and reject the rebase if it isnâ€™t appropriate. Please see the template pre-rebase hook script for an example.</p>   <p>Upon completion, &lt;branch&gt; will be the current branch.</p> </div>   <h2 id="_interactive_mode">Interactive mode</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <p>Rebasing interactively means that you have a chance to edit the commits which are rebased. You can reorder the commits, and you can remove them (weeding out bad or otherwise unwanted patches).</p>   <p>The interactive mode is meant for this type of workflow:</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>have a wonderful idea</p> </li> <li> <p>hack on the code</p> </li> <li> <p>prepare a series for submission</p> </li> <li> <p>submit</p> </li> </ol> </div>  <p>where point 2. consists of several instances of</p>   <p>a) regular use</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>finish something worthy of a commit</p> </li> <li> <p>commit</p> </li> </ol> </div>  <p>b) independent fixup</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>realize that something does not work</p> </li> <li> <p>fix that</p> </li> <li> <p>commit it</p> </li> </ol> </div>  <p>Sometimes the thing fixed in b.2. cannot be amended to the not-quite perfect commit it fixes, because that commit is buried deeply in a patch series. That is exactly what interactive rebase is for: use it after plenty of "a"s and "b"s, by rearranging and editing commits, and squashing multiple commits into one.</p>   <p>Start it with the last commit you want to retain as-is:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>git rebase -i &lt;after-this-commit&gt;</pre> </div> </div>  <p>An editor will be fired up with all the commits in your current branch (ignoring merge commits), which come after the given commit. You can reorder the commits in this list to your heartâ€™s content, and you can remove them. The list looks more or less like this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>pick deadbee The oneline of this commit
pick fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
...</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The oneline descriptions are purely for your pleasure; <code>git rebase</code> will not look at them but at the commit names ("deadbee" and "fa1afe1" in this example), so do not delete or edit the names.</p>   <p>By replacing the command "pick" with the command "edit", you can tell <code>git rebase</code> to stop after applying that commit, so that you can edit the files and/or the commit message, amend the commit, and continue rebasing.</p>   <p>If you just want to edit the commit message for a commit, replace the command "pick" with the command "reword".</p>   <p>To drop a commit, replace the command "pick" with "drop", or just delete the matching line.</p>   <p>If you want to fold two or more commits into one, replace the command "pick" for the second and subsequent commits with "squash" or "fixup". If the commits had different authors, the folded commit will be attributed to the author of the first commit. The suggested commit message for the folded commit is the concatenation of the commit messages of the first commit and of those with the "squash" command, but omits the commit messages of commits with the "fixup" command.</p>   <p><code>git rebase</code> will stop when "pick" has been replaced with "edit" or when a command fails due to merge errors. When you are done editing and/or resolving conflicts you can continue with <code>git rebase --continue</code>.</p>   <p>For example, if you want to reorder the last 5 commits, such that what was HEAD~4 becomes the new HEAD. To achieve that, you would call <code>git rebase</code> like this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>$ git rebase -i HEAD~5</pre> </div> </div>  <p>And move the first patch to the end of the list.</p>   <p>You might want to preserve merges, if you have a history like this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>           X
            \
         A---M---B
        /
---o---O---P---Q</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Suppose you want to rebase the side branch starting at "A" to "Q". Make sure that the current HEAD is "B", and call</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>$ git rebase -i -p --onto Q O</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Reordering and editing commits usually creates untested intermediate steps. You may want to check that your history editing did not break anything by running a test, or at least recompiling at intermediate points in history by using the "exec" command (shortcut "x"). You may do so by creating a todo list like this one:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>pick deadbee Implement feature XXX
fixup f1a5c00 Fix to feature XXX
exec make
pick c0ffeee The oneline of the next commit
edit deadbab The oneline of the commit after
exec cd subdir; make test
...</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The interactive rebase will stop when a command fails (i.e. exits with non-0 status) to give you an opportunity to fix the problem. You can continue with <code>git rebase --continue</code>.</p>   <p>The "exec" command launches the command in a shell (the one specified in <code>$SHELL</code>, or the default shell if <code>$SHELL</code> is not set), so you can use shell features (like "cd", "&gt;", ";" â€¦â€‹). The command is run from the root of the working tree.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>$ git rebase -i --exec "make test"</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This command lets you check that intermediate commits are compilable. The todo list becomes like that:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>pick 5928aea one
exec make test
pick 04d0fda two
exec make test
pick ba46169 three
exec make test
pick f4593f9 four
exec make test</pre> </div> </div>
</div>   <h2 id="_splitting_commits">Splitting commits</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <p>In interactive mode, you can mark commits with the action "edit". However, this does not necessarily mean that <code>git rebase</code> expects the result of this edit to be exactly one commit. Indeed, you can undo the commit, or you can add other commits. This can be used to split a commit into two:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Start an interactive rebase with <code>git rebase -i &lt;commit&gt;^</code>, where &lt;commit&gt; is the commit you want to split. In fact, any commit range will do, as long as it contains that commit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mark the commit you want to split with the action "edit".</p> </li> <li> <p>When it comes to editing that commit, execute <code>git reset HEAD^</code>. The effect is that the HEAD is rewound by one, and the index follows suit. However, the working tree stays the same.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now add the changes to the index that you want to have in the first commit. You can use <code>git add</code> (possibly interactively) or <code>git gui</code> (or both) to do that.</p> </li> <li> <p>Commit the now-current index with whatever commit message is appropriate now.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repeat the last two steps until your working tree is clean.</p> </li> <li> <p>Continue the rebase with <code>git rebase --continue</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>If you are not absolutely sure that the intermediate revisions are consistent (they compile, pass the testsuite, etc.) you should use <code>git stash</code> to stash away the not-yet-committed changes after each commit, test, and amend the commit if fixes are necessary.</p> </div>   <h2 id="_recovering_from_upstream_rebase">Recovering from upstream rebase</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <p>Rebasing (or any other form of rewriting) a branch that others have based work on is a bad idea: anyone downstream of it is forced to manually fix their history. This section explains how to do the fix from the downstreamâ€™s point of view. The real fix, however, would be to avoid rebasing the upstream in the first place.</p>   <p>To illustrate, suppose you are in a situation where someone develops a <code>subsystem</code> branch, and you are working on a <code>topic</code> that is dependent on this <code>subsystem</code>. You might end up with a history like the following:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
	 \
	  o---o---o---o---o  subsystem
			   \
			    *---*---*  topic</pre> </div> </div>  <p>If <code>subsystem</code> is rebased against <code>master</code>, the following happens:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
	 \			 \
	  o---o---o---o---o	  o'--o'--o'--o'--o'  subsystem
			   \
			    *---*---*  topic</pre> </div> </div>  <p>If you now continue development as usual, and eventually merge <code>topic</code> to <code>subsystem</code>, the commits from <code>subsystem</code> will remain duplicated forever:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
	 \			 \
	  o---o---o---o---o	  o'--o'--o'--o'--o'--M	 subsystem
			   \			     /
			    *---*---*-..........-*--*  topic</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Such duplicates are generally frowned upon because they clutter up history, making it harder to follow. To clean things up, you need to transplant the commits on <code>topic</code> to the new <code>subsystem</code> tip, i.e., rebase <code>topic</code>. This becomes a ripple effect: anyone downstream from <code>topic</code> is forced to rebase too, and so on!</p>   <p>There are two kinds of fixes, discussed in the following subsections:</p>  <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1">Easy case: The changes are literally the same.</dt> <dd> <p>This happens if the <code>subsystem</code> rebase was a simple rebase and had no conflicts.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">Hard case: The changes are not the same.</dt> <dd> <p>This happens if the <code>subsystem</code> rebase had conflicts, or used <code>--interactive</code> to omit, edit, squash, or fixup commits; or if the upstream used one of <code>commit --amend</code>, <code>reset</code>, or <code>filter-branch</code>.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_the_easy_case">The easy case</h3>  <p>Only works if the changes (patch IDs based on the diff contents) on <code>subsystem</code> are literally the same before and after the rebase <code>subsystem</code> did.</p>   <p>In that case, the fix is easy because <code>git rebase</code> knows to skip changes that are already present in the new upstream. So if you say (assuming youâ€™re on <code>topic</code>)</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    $ git rebase subsystem</pre> </div> </div>  <p>you will end up with the fixed history</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
				 \
				  o'--o'--o'--o'--o'  subsystem
						   \
						    *---*---*  topic</pre> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_the_hard_case">The hard case</h3>  <p>Things get more complicated if the <code>subsystem</code> changes do not exactly correspond to the ones before the rebase.</p>  <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <div class="title">Note</div> </td> <td class="content"> While an "easy case recovery" sometimes appears to be successful even in the hard case, it may have unintended consequences. For example, a commit that was removed via <code>git rebase
      --interactive</code> will be <strong>resurrected</strong>! </td> </tr> </table> </div>  <p>The idea is to manually tell <code>git rebase</code> "where the old <code>subsystem</code> ended and your <code>topic</code> began", that is, what the old merge-base between them was. You will have to find a way to name the last commit of the old <code>subsystem</code>, for example:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>With the <code>subsystem</code> reflog: after <code>git fetch</code>, the old tip of <code>subsystem</code> is at <code>subsystem@{1}</code>. Subsequent fetches will increase the number. (See <a href="git-reflog">git-reflog[1]</a>.)</p> </li> <li> <p>Relative to the tip of <code>topic</code>: knowing that your <code>topic</code> has three commits, the old tip of <code>subsystem</code> must be <code>topic~3</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>You can then transplant the old <code>subsystem..topic</code> to the new tip by saying (for the reflog case, and assuming you are on <code>topic</code> already):</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>    $ git rebase --onto subsystem subsystem@{1}</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The ripple effect of a "hard case" recovery is especially bad: <code>everyone</code> downstream from <code>topic</code> will now have to perform a "hard case" recovery too!</p>  </div>
</div>   <h2 id="_bugs">Bugs</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <p>The todo list presented by <code>--preserve-merges --interactive</code> does not represent the topology of the revision graph. Editing commits and rewording their commit messages should work fine, but attempts to reorder commits tend to produce counterintuitive results.</p>   <p>For example, an attempt to rearrange</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>1 --- 2 --- 3 --- 4 --- 5</pre> </div> </div>  <p>to</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>1 --- 2 --- 4 --- 3 --- 5</pre> </div> </div>  <p>by moving the "pick 4" line will result in the following history:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>	3
       /
1 --- 2 --- 4 --- 5</pre> </div> </div>
