The output of this command is convenient for e-mail submission or for use with <code>git am</code>.</p>   <p>There are two ways to specify which commits to operate on.</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>A single commit, &lt;since&gt;, specifies that the commits leading to the tip of the current branch that are not in the history that leads to the &lt;since&gt; to be output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Generic &lt;revision range&gt; expression (see "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions">gitrevisions[7]</a>) means the commits in the specified range.</p> </li> </ol> </div>  <p>The first rule takes precedence in the case of a single &lt;commit&gt;. To apply the second rule, i.e., format everything since the beginning of history up until &lt;commit&gt;, use the <code>\--root</code> option: <code>git format-patch
--root &lt;commit&gt;</code>. If you want to format only &lt;commit&gt; itself, you can do this with <code>git format-patch -1 &lt;commit&gt;</code>.</p>   <p>By default, each output file is numbered sequentially from 1, and uses the first line of the commit message (massaged for pathname safety) as the filename. With the <code>--numbered-files</code> option, the output file names will only be numbers, without the first line of the commit appended. The names of the output files are printed to standard output, unless the <code>--stdout</code> option is specified.</p>   <p>If <code>-o</code> is specified, output files are created in &lt;dir&gt;. Otherwise they are created in the current working directory. The default path can be set with the <code>format.outputDirectory</code> configuration option. The <code>-o</code> option takes precedence over <code>format.outputDirectory</code>. To store patches in the current working directory even when <code>format.outputDirectory</code> points elsewhere, use <code>-o .</code>.</p>   <p>By default, the subject of a single patch is "[PATCH] " followed by the concatenation of lines from the commit message up to the first blank line (see the DISCUSSION section of <a href="git-commit">git-commit[1]</a>).</p>   <p>When multiple patches are output, the subject prefix will instead be "[PATCH n/m] ". To force 1/1 to be added for a single patch, use <code>-n</code>. To omit patch numbers from the subject, use <code>-N</code>.</p>   <p>If given <code>--thread</code>, <code>git-format-patch</code> will generate <code>In-Reply-To</code> and <code>References</code> headers to make the second and subsequent patch mails appear as replies to the first mail; this also generates a <code>Message-Id</code> header to reference.</p> </div>   <h2 id="_options">Options</h2> <div class="sectionbody">

By default, as much space as necessary will be used for the filename part, and the rest for the graph part. Maximum width defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns if not connected to a terminal, and can be overridden by <code>&lt;width&gt;</code>. The width of the filename part can be limited by giving another width <code>&lt;name-width&gt;</code> after a comma. The width of the graph part can be limited by using <code>--stat-graph-width=&lt;width&gt;</code> (affects all commands generating a stat graph) or by setting <code>diff.statGraphWidth=&lt;width&gt;</code> (does not affect <code>git format-patch</code>). By giving a third parameter <code>&lt;count&gt;</code>, you can limit the output to the first <code>&lt;count&gt;</code> lines, followed by <code>...</code> if there are more.</p>  <p>These parameters can also be set individually with <code>--stat-width=&lt;width&gt;</code>, <code>--stat-name-width=&lt;name-width&gt;</code> and <code>--stat-count=&lt;count&gt;</code>.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">--numstat</dt> <dd> <p>Similar to <code>--stat</code>, but shows number of added and deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly.

The behavior of <code>--dirstat</code> can be customized by passing it a comma separated list of parameters. The defaults are controlled by the <code>diff.dirstat</code> configuration variable (see <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a>). The following parameters are available:</p> <div class="openblock"> <div class="content"> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1"><code>changes</code></dt> <dd> <p>Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been removed from the source, or added to the destination. This ignores the amount of pure code movements within a file. In other words, rearranging lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default behavior when no parameter is given.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1"><code>lines</code></dt> <dd> <p>Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For binary files, count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural concept of lines). This is a more expensive <code>--dirstat</code> behavior than the <code>changes</code> behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as much as other changes. The resulting output is consistent with what you get from the other <code>--*stat</code> options.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1"><code>files</code></dt> <dd> <p>Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files changed. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis. This is the computationally cheapest <code>--dirstat</code> behavior, since it does not have to look at the file contents at all.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1"><code>cumulative</code></dt> <dd> <p>Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as well. Note that when using <code>cumulative</code>, the sum of the percentages reported may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative) behavior can be specified with the <code>noncumulative</code> parameter.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">&lt;limit&gt;</dt> <dd> <p>An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by default). Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes are not shown in the output.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div>  <p>Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories: <code>--dirstat=files,10,cumulative</code>.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">--summary</dt> <dd> <p>Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as creations, renames and mode changes.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">--no-renames</dt> <dd> <p>Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration file gives the default to do so.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">--full-index</dt> <dd> <p>Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full pre- and post-image blob object names on the "index" line when generating patch format output.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">--binary</dt> <dd> <p>In addition to <code>--full-index</code>, output a binary diff that can be applied with <code>git-apply</code>.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">--abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]</dt> <dd> <p>Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object name in diff-raw format output and diff-tree header lines, show only a partial prefix. This is independent of the <code>--full-index</code> option above, which controls the diff-patch output format. Non default number of digits can be specified with <code>--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;</code>.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">-B[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;]</dt> <dt class="hdlist1">--break-rewrites[=[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;]]</dt> <dd> <p>Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create. This serves two purposes:</p>  <p>It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new, and the number <code>m</code> controls this aspect of the -B option (defaults to 60%). <code>-B/70%</code> specifies that less than 30% of the original should remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i.e. otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with context lines).</p>   <p>When used with -M, a totally-rewritten file is also considered as the source of a rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared as the source of a rename), and the number <code>n</code> controls this aspect of the -B option (defaults to 50%). <code>-B20%</code> specifies that a change with addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file’s size are eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to another file.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">-M[&lt;n&gt;]</dt> <dt class="hdlist1">--find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]</dt> <dd> <p>Detect renames. If <code>n</code> is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity index (i.e. amount of addition/deletions compared to the file’s size). For example, <code>-M90%</code> means Git should consider a delete/add pair to be a rename if more than 90% of the file hasn’t changed. Without a <code>%</code> sign, the number is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point before it. I.e., <code>-M5</code> becomes 0.5, and is thus the same as <code>-M50%</code>. Similarly, <code>-M05</code> is the same as <code>-M5%</code>. To limit detection to exact renames, use <code>-M100%</code>. The default similarity index is 50%.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">-C[&lt;n&gt;]</dt> <dt class="hdlist1">--find-copies[=&lt;n&gt;]</dt> <dd> <p>Detect copies as well as renames. See also <code>--find-copies-harder</code>. If <code>n</code> is specified, it has the same meaning as for <code>-M&lt;n&gt;</code>.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">--find-copies-harder</dt> <dd> <p>For performance reasons, by default, <code>-C</code> option finds copies only if the original file of the copy was modified in the same changeset. This flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates for the source of copy. This is a very expensive operation for large projects, so use it with caution. Giving more than one <code>-C</code> option has the same effect.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">-D</dt> <dt class="hdlist1">--irreversible-delete</dt> <dd> <p>Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header but not the diff between the preimage and <code>/dev/null</code>. The resulting patch is not meant to be applied with <code>patch</code> or <code>git apply</code>; this is solely for people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the text after the change. In addition, the output obviously lack enough information to apply such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of the option.</p>  <p>When used together with <code>-B</code>, omit also the preimage in the deletion part of a delete/create pair.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">-l&lt;num&gt;</dt> <dd> <p>The <code>-M</code> and <code>-C</code> options require O(n^2) processing time where n is the number of potential rename/copy targets. This option prevents rename/copy detection from running if the number of rename/copy targets exceeds the specified number.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">-O&lt;orderfile&gt;</dt> <dd> <p>Output the patch in the order specified in the &lt;orderfile&gt;, which has one shell glob pattern per line. This overrides the <code>diff.orderFile</code> configuration variable (see <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a>).

When "untracked" is used submodules are not considered dirty when they only contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified content). Using "dirty" ignores all changes to the work tree of submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are shown (this was the behavior until 1.7.0).

arch/arm config files were slimmed down using a python script
(See commit c2330e286f68f1c408b4aa6515ba49d57f05beae comment)

Do the same for ia64 so we can have sleek &amp; trim looking
...</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Typically it will be placed in a MUA’s drafts folder, edited to add timely commentary that should not go in the changelog after the three dashes, and then sent as a message whose body, in our example, starts with "arch/arm config files were…​". On the receiving end, readers can save interesting patches in a UNIX mailbox and apply them with <a href="git-am">git-am[1]</a>.</p>   <p>When a patch is part of an ongoing discussion, the patch generated by <code>git format-patch</code> can be tweaked to take advantage of the <code>git am --scissors</code> feature. After your response to the discussion comes a line that consists solely of "<code>-- &gt;8 --</code>" (scissors and perforation), followed by the patch with unnecessary header fields removed:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>...
&gt; So we should do such-and-such.

Makes sense to me.  How about this patch?

Subject: [IA64] Put ia64 config files on the Uwe Kleine-K��nig diet

arch/arm config files were slimmed down using a python script
...</pre> </div> </div>  <p>When sending a patch this way, most often you are sending your own patch, so in addition to the "<code>From $SHA1 $magic_timestamp</code>" marker you should omit <code>From:</code> and <code>Date:</code> lines from the patch file. The patch title is likely to be different from the subject of the discussion the patch is in response to, so it is likely that you would want to keep the Subject: line, like the example above.</p>  <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_checking_for_patch_corruption">Checking for patch corruption</h3>  <p>Many mailers if not set up properly will corrupt whitespace. Here are two common types of corruption:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Empty context lines that do not have <code>any</code> whitespace.</p> </li> <li> <p>Non-empty context lines that have one extra whitespace at the beginning.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>One way to test if your MUA is set up correctly is:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Send the patch to yourself, exactly the way you would, except with To: and Cc: lines that do not contain the list and maintainer address.</p> </li> <li> <p>Save that patch to a file in UNIX mailbox format. Call it a.patch, say.</p> </li> <li> <p>Apply it:</p> <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>$ git fetch &lt;project&gt; master:test-apply
$ git checkout test-apply
$ git reset --hard
$ git am a.patch</pre> </div> </div> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>If it does not apply correctly, there can be various reasons.</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>The patch itself does not apply cleanly. That is <code>bad</code> but does not have much to do with your MUA. You might want to rebase the patch with <a href="git-rebase">git-rebase[1]</a> before regenerating it in this case.</p> </li> <li> <p>The MUA corrupted your patch; "am" would complain that the patch does not apply. Look in the .git/rebase-apply/ subdirectory and see what <code>patch</code> file contains and check for the common corruption patterns mentioned above.</p> </li> <li> <p>While at it, check the <code>info</code> and <code>final-commit</code> files as well. If what is in <code>final-commit</code> is not exactly what you would want to see in the commit log message, it is very likely that the receiver would end up hand editing the log message when applying your patch. Things like "Hi, this is my first patch.\n" in the patch e-mail should come after the three-dash line that signals the end of the commit message.</p> </li> </ul> </div> </div>
</div>   <h2 id="_mua_specific_hints">Mua-specific hints</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <p>Here are some hints on how to successfully submit patches inline using various mailers.</p>  <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_gmail">GMail</h3>  <p>GMail does not have any way to turn off line wrapping in the web interface, so it will mangle any emails that you send. You can however use "git send-email" and send your patches through the GMail SMTP server, or use any IMAP email client to connect to the google IMAP server and forward the emails through that.</p>   <p>For hints on using <code>git send-email</code> to send your patches through the GMail SMTP server, see the EXAMPLE section of <a href="git-send-email">git-send-email[1]</a>.</p>   <p>For hints on submission using the IMAP interface, see the EXAMPLE section of <a href="git-imap-send">git-imap-send[1]</a>.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_thunderbird">Thunderbird</h3>  <p>By default, Thunderbird will both wrap emails as well as flag them as being <code>format=flowed</code>, both of which will make the resulting email unusable by Git.</p>   <p>There are three different approaches: use an add-on to turn off line wraps, configure Thunderbird to not mangle patches, or use an external editor to keep Thunderbird from mangling the patches.</p>  <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_approach_1_add_on">Approach #1 (add-on)</h4>  <p>Install the Toggle Word Wrap add-on that is available from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/toggle-word-wrap/" class="bare">https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/toggle-word-wrap/</a> It adds a menu entry "Enable Word Wrap" in the composer’s "Options" menu that you can tick off. Now you can compose the message as you otherwise do (cut + paste, <code>git format-patch</code> | <code>git imap-send</code>, etc), but you have to insert line breaks manually in any text that you type.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_approach_2_configuration">Approach #2 (configuration)</h4>  <p>Three steps:</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>Configure your mail server composition as plain text: Edit…​Account Settings…​Composition &amp; Addressing, uncheck "Compose Messages in HTML".</p> </li> <li> <p>Configure your general composition window to not wrap.</p>  <p>In Thunderbird 2: Edit..Preferences..Composition, wrap plain text messages at 0</p>   <p>In Thunderbird 3: Edit..Preferences..Advanced..Config Editor. Search for "mail.wrap_long_lines". Toggle it to make sure it is set to <code>false</code>. Also, search for "mailnews.wraplength" and set the value to 0.</p>  </li> <li> <p>Disable the use of format=flowed: Edit..Preferences..Advanced..Config Editor. Search for "mailnews.send_plaintext_flowed". Toggle it to make sure it is set to <code>false</code>.</p> </li> </ol> </div>  <p>After that is done, you should be able to compose email as you otherwise would (cut + paste, <code>git format-patch</code> | <code>git imap-send</code>, etc), and the patches will not be mangled.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_approach_3_external_editor">Approach #3 (external editor)</h4>  <p>The following Thunderbird extensions are needed: AboutConfig from <a href="http://aboutconfig.mozdev.org/" class="bare">http://aboutconfig.mozdev.org/</a> and External Editor from <a href="http://globs.org/articles.php?lng=en&amp;pg=8" class="bare">http://globs.org/articles.php?lng=en&amp;pg=8</a></p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>Prepare the patch as a text file using your method of choice.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before opening a compose window, use Edit→Account Settings to uncheck the "Compose messages in HTML format" setting in the "Composition &amp; Addressing" panel of the account to be used to send the patch.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the main Thunderbird window, <code>before</code> you open the compose window for the patch, use Tools→about:config to set the following to the indicated values:</p> <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>	mailnews.send_plaintext_flowed  =&gt; false
